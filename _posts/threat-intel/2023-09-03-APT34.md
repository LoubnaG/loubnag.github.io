### Overview
APT34 (also known as Helix Kitten or OilReg) is a hacker group identified by CrowdStrike as iranian, operating primarily in the Middle East by targeting organizations and many industries in this region such as aerospace, energy, financial, government, hospitality and telecommunications industry.
In 2018, Helix Kitten actors were observed targeting entities mostly across the Middle Eastern region.
Targets appeared to be located in Bahrain and Kuwait. These incidents involved spear-phishing attacks, a principal characteristic of Helix Kitten, included emails containing malicious PowerShell in their macros that connects to known C2 infrastructure.<br>
OilRig, Cobalt Gypsy, Helminth, APT34, IRN2 are community names associated with this actor.

### Motivations
The APT34's attacks align with the national interests of Iran which are economic, geopolitical, military, financial and political interests. The cyber espionage compaigns conducted by This adversary group increased with the increasing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East to press decision makers and key organizations that may have information that furthers Iran's economic and national security goals. <br>
The infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests lead FireEye to assess that APT34 acts on behalf of the Iranian government.

### Techniques
The APT34 group primarily rely on social engineering to exploit the human rather than software vulnerabilities. The group uses 
also uses custom DNS Tunneling protocols for command and control (C2) and data exfiltration,Custom web-shells and backdoors used to persistently access servers
 Microsoft Excel macros, PowerShell-based exploits to gain access to its targets.
After OilRig gains access to a system, they use credential dumping tools, such as Mimikatz, to steal credentials to accounts logged into the compromised system. <br><br>
ðŸ“Œ Some Techniques used By APT34 group according to Mitre Att&ck:
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> Phishing: </span> <br>
 <span style="color:#909090">Spearphishing Attachment:</span> OilRig has sent spearphising emails with malicious attachments to potential victims using compromised and/or spoofed email accounts. <br>
 <span style="color:#909090">Spearphishing Link: </span> OilRig has sent spearphising emails with malicious links to potential victims.<br>
 <span style="color:#909090">Spearphishing via Service:</span> OilRig has used LinkedIn to send spearphishing links. 
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> Masquerading: </span> The group has used .doc file extensions to mask malicious executables.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> Remote Services (SSH): </span> The group has used Putty to access compromised systems.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> Drive-by Compromise: </span> OilRig has been seen utilizing watering hole attacks to collect credentials which could be used to gain access into ICS networks.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> Brute Force: </span> to obtain credentials.

ðŸ“Œ Softwares and malicious programs used by APT34:
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> BONDUPDATER: </span> a PowerShell backdoor.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> QUADAGENT:  </span> a PowerShell backdoor.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> POWRUNER: </span>  a PowerShell script that sends and receives commands to and from the C2 server.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> SEASHARPEE: </span>  a Web shell.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> SideTwist: </span> a C-based backdoor that has been used since at least 2021.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> Helminth: </span>  a backdoor that has at least two variants - one written in VBScript and PowerShell that is delivered via a macros in Excel spreadsheets, and one that is a standalone Windows executable.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> LaZagne: </span>  a post-exploitation, open-source tool used to recover stored passwords on a system.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed"> certutil: </span>  a command-line utility that can be used to obtain certificate authority information and configure Certificate Services.

### Conclusion
Organizations should be aware of the APT34 techniques used to target their systems, and conduct a Phishing awareness training to educate the employees on how to spot and report suspected phishing attempts, to protect themselves and the company from cybercriminals like APT34 Group.<br>
Indicators of compromise (IoC) are clues and evidence during a cybersecurity incident.
Cybersecurity experts especially threat hunting and threat intelligence teams should hunt for these indicators then use them to confirm cyberattack occurrences and deploy these indicators within their Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tool to build cyber-defense strategies and help secure the environment from future attacks.
