<span style="color:#909090">Investigating a Web brute force attack on Splunk</span>

In this writeup we will be investigating a Web brute force attack on Splunk ðŸŽ¯

# Challenge Scenario

| ![CTF Challenge](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute1.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *CTF Challenge* |

We can extract some the key information from the challenge description:
- The target server has the IP address 192.168.250.70 which means it's the destination IP address
- We need to investigate in HTTP traffic since it is a web brute force attack as mentioned

# Find Attacker's IP Address
We will use the following splunk query to figure out the attacker:

| ![Splunk Query](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute2.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Splunk Query* |

explanation:<br>
- `sourcetype = "stream:http"`: since the attack is a web brute force
- `http_method = POST`: because brute force attacks are performed through login forms to authenticate users and the HTTP method most often used for authentication is the "POST" method. 
- `dest_ip=192.168.250.70`: becasue the target server is at 192.168.250.70, so all the HTTP traffic will be coming to this address.<br>

let's see the source IPs we have in the `src_ip` field from the search result:

| ![Source Addresses](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute3.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Source Addresses* |

We have 2 source IP addresses. We will add the first one which is 40.80.148.42 to the previous search query to see the traffic originating from this address:

| ![Search Query](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute4.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Search Query* |

To see the traffic content related to "POST" requests we have to check the `form_data` field:

| ![Form Data Of 40.80.148.42 IP Address](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute5.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Form Data Of 40.80.148.42 IP Address* |

The content is clean and nothing indicates that there was a brute force attack.<br>
Let's move to the second source IP address which is 23.22.63.114:<br>

| ![Search Query](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute6.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Search Query* |

We found 412 events related to this query. Next, We will check the `form_data` field to see the HTTP traffic originating from this address:

| ![Form Data Of 23.22.63.114 IP Address](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute7.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Form Data Of 23.22.63.114 IP Address* |

It's obviously a brute force attack as we notice many login attempts with username "admin" and multiple passwords. The attacker tried to get the administrator account !<br>
Before moving to next step, we have to confirm what we found by counting the number of attaker's IP address to see how many login attempts were made:

| ![Counting Login attempts](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute8.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Counting Login attempts* |

The count of the 23.22.63.114 attacker IP address is way higher than the other source IP address.<br>
We can conclude that a brute force attack was performed on the web server by the 23.22.63.114

# Find The Password Length

| ![Search Query For Password Length](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute9.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Search Query For Password Length* |

In the previous search we used `rex` command to extract password length using regular expressions at search time by:
- specifying `form_data` as field to rex from
- specifying "passwd=(?<pwd_len>\w+)" as regular expression <br>

ðŸ’¡<br>
`?`  : match zero or one <br>
`w+` : means "one or more alphanumeric characters."

| ![Result](/assets/images/soc/Brute-Force/brute10.png ) | 
|:--:| 
| *Result* |

As shown in the previous screenshot, The password length is 6 since the result is 6.1774...<br>

ðŸš©Flag:<br>
flag{23.22.63.114_6}
