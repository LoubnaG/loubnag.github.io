### Why Linux?
- Open Source
  - Open source software is software with source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and share.
  - Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization that created it can see, or change, or distribute. This software is called "closed sourceâ€œ
  - Open source does not mean it is somehow not able to be used or provided commercially, Most commonly, vendors such as Red Hat provide commercial help with deploying, supporting, and extending solutions based on open source products.
- Secure
  - When you have Windows installed, you need to download/purchase an Antivirus program to keep your computer safe from hackers and malwares.However, Linux does not require the use of such Anti-Virus programs.
- Perfect For Programmers
  - Linux supports almost all of the major programming languages (Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, Ruby, etc.). Moreover, it offers a vast range of applications useful for programming purposes.
- Variety Of Distributions
  - You will find tons of Linux distribution catered for a different set of needs. So, you can choose to install any of the available Linux distros according to your requirements.
- Free to Use
  - Linux is accessible to the public for free! However, that is not the case with Windows!
- Reliability
  - You will want to re-install Windows after a while when you encounter crashes or slowdowns on your system.
  - If you are using Linux, you will not have to worry about re-installing it just to experience a faster and a smoother system.
  - Linux helps your system run smooth for a longer period (in fact, much longer!).
