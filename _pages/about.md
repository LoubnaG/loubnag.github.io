<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a Final year Cybersecurity Engineering Student and Blue Team Enthusiast, always seeking for new opportunities that  
align my passion with my professional goals.<br>
The school subjects I studied throughout the Cybersecurity specialization along with my self-study program motivated 
me significantly to dig deeper into the field of cybersecurity and strengthen my knowledge and technical skills as well as my soft skills in terms of being an effective team member in the work environment.<br>
As a final year Cybersecurity Student, I fancy myself walking in the shoes of a cyber security professional in the next few years, working in the SOC (Security Operations Center) team and evolving into Incident Response field.

## <i class="fas fa-fw fa-trophy"></i> Projects

- Web vulnerability scanner :
  - Implementation with : NodeJS, MYSQL, HTML and CSS.<br>
  ```We built a Web vulnerability scanner that identify security weaknesses in websites and web applications. The scanner we built is based on a database that contains payloads to be sent to the website we're scanning and based on the server response, the vulnerability scanner decide whether the website is vulnerable or not.``` <br>
  ```These payloads are corresponding to SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), LDAP Injection and Directory Indexing.```

- VoIP Project :<br>
 ```In this project, We studied the security weaknesses of VoIP (Voice Over IP) technology. We simulated various attacks including MITM (Man In The Middle), Eavesdropping, DOS (Denial Of Service) and attacks on users passwords.```<br>   
    
  <!-- ðŸ”— [Demo Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RsAP6A5rNs) -->
- Face recognition system and emotions detection :
  - Implementation with : Python, Viola Jones algorithm, CNN (convolutional neural network).<br>
  ```Our application has many features starting with user authentication to use our face recognition system and emotions detection tool. Once the user is authenticated successfully, they can upload a video of their choice to detect people's face along with their names or use their webcame for live face detection.```<br>
  ```The emotions detection is another feature on our application that once detect the user's emotion it gives them a list of proposed activities depending on the detected emotion.
