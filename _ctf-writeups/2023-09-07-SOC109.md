<span style="color:#909090">Investigating the famous malware Emotet detected in a word ducument on LetsDefend</span>

Today we will be investigating The SOC109 Case on LetsDefend plateform. In this case, the Emotet malware will be discussed and analyzed in details.<br>Let's start üéØ

### Security Alert 
We start our investigation by reviewing the alert's information about the event occurred on March 22,2021.<br>
More information about the incident are shown in the screenshot below :

| ![incident details](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_1.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *incident details* |

The alert indicates that the incident is related to RichardPRD endpoint that was infected by the malicious file "1word.doc".<br>
The infected device is cleaned but we have to conduct further investigations on this incident.

### Detection and Analysis
In this phase, our main goal is :
- Define Threat indicator
- Check if malware is quarantined/cleaned
- Analyse the Malware in 3rd party tools and find C2 addresees
- Check if someone requested the C2 address
- Add artifacts

üìç What is Emotet Malware ? <br>

Emotet is a malware that first appeared in 2014 as a banking Trojan and spreads mainly via phishing emails attachments and links. The main goal of Emotet is to extract sensitive information from the victim‚Äôs computer. <br>
According to Kaspersky, Emotet evolved from a banking Trojan into a Dropper, which means that the Trojan reloads malware onto devices. These are then responsible for the actual damage to the system.<br>
In most cases the following programs were ‚Äòdropped‚Äô:
- <span style="color:#cad2ed">Trickster </span> (also known as TrickLoader and TrickBot): A banking Trojan that attempts to gain access to the login data of bank accounts.
- <span style="color:#cad2ed">Ryuk :</span> An Encryption Trojan - also known as a Cryptotrojan or Ransomware - encrypts data and thus blocks the user of the computer from accessing this data or the entire system. <br>
Now, it's time to analyze the malicious file called 1word.doc related to Emotet malware.<br>

üìç Analysis with VirusTotal :<br>

| ![VirusTotal result](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_2.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *VirusTotal result* |

The file 1word.doc is identified as malicious by VT according to 46 security vendors and 6 sandboxes as shown in the screenshot above.<br>
In the *Relations* tab we can see all the malicious URLs related to Emotet malware, malicious domains and C2 addresse :<br>

Malicious URLs :

| ![Malicious URLs related to Emotet](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_3.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Malicious URLs related to Emotet* |

Malicious Domains :

| ![Malicious domains related to Emotet](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_4.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Malicious domains related to Emotet* |

Malicious IP addresses :

|:--:| 
| *Malicious IP addresses related to Emotet* |

<span style="color:#add894">We can take note of theses findings to add them as artifacts in our security playbook.</span><br>

üìç Analysis with AnyRun :<br>

We uploaded the zip file to AnyRun Malware Sandbox to expand our investigation. And here's the result :

| ![AnyRun Results](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_6.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *AnyRun Results* |

The file is identified as malicious too.<br>
On the right window of AnyRun we can find all the processes run by Emotet malware once it access the target system :

| ![Processes and commands run by Emotet](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_7.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Processes and commands run by Emotet* |

Here in the previous screenshot we notice a powershell command run by Emotet. It's obviously base64-encoded. Let's decode it to see result :

 | ![Powershell command run by Emotet after base64 decode](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_8.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Powershell command run by Emotet after base64 decode* |

The PowerShell command is still obfuscated using ‚Äò.‚Äô to separate every character. We will remove them to see the whole command :

| ![Powershell command run by Emotet after null bytes removed](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_9.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Powershell command run by Emotet after null bytes removed* |

We can notice the URLs used within the script in the previous screenshot are also separated by "+" character. For example the URL : <span style="color:#909090">http:‚Äô+‚Äô//‚Äô+‚Äômemtre‚Äô+‚Äôat‚Äô+‚Äô.com/TO‚Äô+‚Äôn9‚Äô+‚ÄôK5‚Äô+‚Äô1QK1pJ2qI‚Äô+‚Äô_SKaebFAz</span> which is in fact <span style="color:#cad2ed">hxxp://memtreat[.]com/TOn9K51QK1pJ2qI_SKaebFAz/</span><br>

The same goes for all the URLs used within the command. We will get at the end :
- hxxp://memtreat[.]com/TOn9K51QK1pJ2qI_SKaebFAz/
- hxxp://medongho[.]vn/SVm5yC0s
- hxxp://otojack.co[.]id/wp-content/uploads/xvVQc2RzdDhTWswVa
- hxxp://ptmmf.co[.]id/uNVMPELTQ_ldQ
- hxxp://potlackariet[.]sk/bXfkJ2SeKd7g<br>

<span style="color:#da2039">These URLs are the C2 URLs used to download the malware.</span>

### Artifacts
In this step, we will add artifacts to our EDR Tools to avoid a similar incident in the future. I've added primarily the MD5 hash of the malicious file 1word.doc related to Emotet malware :

| ![Adding artifacts](/assets/images/ctf-writeups/SOC109/SOC109_10.png) | 
|:--:| 
| *Adding artifacts* | 

We can Also add the C2 IP addresses identified previously by VirusTotal as well as the C2 URLs discovered in the Powershell command.

### Playbook
As a final step, we will fill the security playbook by answering the following questions :
  - Malware quarantined/cleaned?  &nbsp; <span style="color: #909090">Yes, According to the alert details provided before.</span>
  - Analyze the malware. Is it safe or malicious?  &nbsp; <span style="color: #909090">Malicious</span>
  - Tools used during the analysis : &nbsp; <span style="color: #909090">VirusTotal, AnyRun Sandbox</span>
  - Check If Someone Requested the C2  &nbsp; <span style="color: #909090">Malicious addresses are not accessed by anyone after inspecting the log management page.</span>

### Close Alert
Finally, the incident is identified as True Positive (TP) and was mitigated successfully. We can close the alert !
