<span style="color:#909090">Analyzing XLS File</span>

Today we will solve the "Remote Working" challenge on LetsDefend. We will work on an XLS zipped file to answer the questions and complete the challenge.<br>

ðŸ“Œ File Downlaod : <br>
<span style="color:#da2039">NOTE : Do not open on your local environment. It is a malicious file.</span><br>
First we will download the zip file and extracted in our virtual environment to keep our local machine safe.<br>
The XLS file that should be analyzed is called "ORDER SHEET & SPEC.xlsm" as shown in the screenshot below :

| *File Analysis with VT* |

We will examine all the information provided by VT to answer the challenge questions.

ðŸš© What is the date the file was created? <br>
To answer this question, we will open up the *Details tab* and scroll down to *History* section where the creation time is indicated as below :

ðŸš© With what name is the file detected by Bitdefender antivirus? <br>
back again the *Detection tab*, we will look in the *Security Vendor'S Analysis* list for BitDefender.
